## Rosa, KEÃ˜VTF

I'm a programmer and computer engineer, and I got my license in May 2019 because radio is such a fun subject to learn. I love tinkering with electronics, and electromagnetism is magical, so radio is a really engaging hobby.

My shack is small; apartment living and ham radio don't mix very well. My HF rig is a QCX CW transceiver from QRP Labs, and my antenna is the MFJ-1622 apartment antenna. It's a loaded vertical, and it's all I can manage to fit in my current shack. I still need to work on my CW, I know my letters but I can only copy if you go super slow. I promise I'm working on it!

I also chat on the local VHF repeater with a Yaesu FT-70D. I even peek into DMR talkgroups on a Baofeng DM-1701 every once in a while. DMR is neat but it's such a pain to set up.

My goals for the year are to improve my CW speed, and to earn my Amateur Extra license. I also plan to buy a proper HF rig sometime soon. I want to get involved with SOTA, and I also want to be able to chat on SSB on the HF bands.
