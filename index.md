## Rosa, KEÃ˜VTF

I'm a programmer and computer engineer, and I got my license in May 2019 because radio is such a fun subject to learn.
I love tinkering with electronics, and electromagnetism is magical, so radio is a really engaging hobby.

My shack is small; apartment living and ham radio don't mix very well.
My HF rig is an Icom IC-718, and I'm currently experimenting with antennas.
My main antenna is a dipole for 20 meters.

I also chat on the local VHF repeater with a Yaesu FT-70D.
I even peek into DMR talkgroups on a Baofeng DM-1701 every once in a while.
DMR is neat but it's such a pain to set up.

My goals for the year are to improve my CW speed, and to earn my Amateur Extra license.
I also plan to buy a proper HF rig sometime soon.
I want to get involved with SOTA, and I also want to be able to chat on SSB on the HF bands.

I'm on [QRZ](https://www.qrz.com/db/KE0VTF), and here are some [links to my social media pages](https://about.me/rosa.richter).
