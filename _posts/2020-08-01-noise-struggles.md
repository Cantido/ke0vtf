title:  "Struggles with Noise"
---

I recently bought my very first proper HF rig, the Icom IC-718.
My intention was to use it with my MFJ apartment antenna, but I already knew it wasn't ideal, so I built a dipole.
It's a classic dipole: two five-meter-long wires soldered to the center pin and outer shield of a SO-239 connector.
It tuned up really nicely; I got it resonant on 20 meters and the SWR is only 1.2:1.

I'm really pleased with the antenna, but that's where the good luck ends.
I tuned up the antenna and heard nothing but noise on every frequency.
I ran the scanner, and got nothing.
In order to get a point of comparison, I fired up the [Northern Utah WebSDR][websdr],
which is just one state to the west of me.
That should show me any signals that I can reasonably hear.
Unfortunately, despite a lot of traffic on twenty meters, and tuning my IC-718 to the same frequencies I was seeing activity, I could hear nothing.
My noise level was beyond S9.

I live in an apartment in a fairly large town, so noise is my arch-enemy.
At the very least, I'm on the top floor of my building, so an antenna taped to the wall near my ceiling shouldn't be blocked by much.
However, I'm surrounded by apartments, and so I'm surrounded by noise generators.
Shutting off all the equipment in my shack didn't seem to affect my noise,
so I need to look farther away.

Another alternative to hunting noise is to just use a directional antenna that should reject most of the noise coming from below me.
Being on the top floor, I imagine that most of my noise is coming from below me.
So, my next project will be to build a cheap magnetic loop or something similar.
Again, since I'm in an apartment, my options are limited.
I'm looking for any directional antenna that I can reasonably mount inside a 10x10 room.

This fight will be ongoing.
I haven't been able to make my first QSO with this noise, so I have a lot of motivation to cut down on my noise level.
